# Jami

Jami is the simplest and easiest way to connect with people (and devices) using video and voice calling over the Internet and [intranet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intranet) ([LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network), [WAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network)).

Jami is a free/libre, end-to-end encrypted, and private communication platform.

Jami – which used to be known as Ring – is also an open-source alternative (to Teams, Zoom, Skype) that prioritizes the privacy of its users.

Jami has a professional-looking design and is available for a wide range of platforms. Unlike the alternatives, calls using Jami are directly between users as it does not use servers to handle calls.

This gives you even greater privacy, as the decentralized nature of Jami means your calls are only between you and the person you are calling – no one else can see (or hear).

Jami has a good selection of features, such as HD video calling, instant messaging, voice messaging, and file sharing.

Jami has multiple [plugins](https://jami.net/plugins/) available, such as:
* **Whisper transcript** which runs live transcription _**locally**_ on your device, and
* **Greenscreen** to modify your background during a video call.

Jami is totally free to use.
