## Jami

Jami, a GNU package, is software for universal and distributed peer-to-peer communication that respects the freedom and privacy of its users.

Jami is the simplest and easiest way to connect with people (and devices) with instant messaging, audio, and video calls over the Internet and LAN/WAN intranets.

Jami is a free/libre, end-to-end encrypted, and private communication platform.

Jami is open-source software that prioritizes user privacy.

Jami has a professional-looking design and is available for a wide range of platforms. Unlike the alternatives, Jami calls are directly between users, as it does not use servers to handle calls.

This gives the greatest privacy, as the distributed nature of Jami means your calls are only between participants.

One-to-one and group conversations with Jami are enhanced with instant messaging, audio and video calling, recording and sending audio and video messages, file transfers, screen sharing, and location sharing.

Jami can also function as a SIP client.

Multiple Jami [extensions](https://jami.net/extensions/) are available:
* **Audio Filter**—Apply a reverb filter to your video. Use Jami for online music sessions and play music online.
* **Auto Answer**—Set up a bot that automatically answers with given text.
* **Green Screen**—Modify your background during a video call or add a blur effect.
* **Segmentation**—Segmentation runs the YOLO model on the video stream and displays the segmentation results.
* **Watermark**—Add your own logo and additional information (text, the current date and time) to your video.
* **Whisper Transcript**—Use an AI model running locally on your device to automatically subtitle the conversation in real time!

Jami can be easily deployed in organizations with the _JAMS_ (Jami Account Management Server), allowing users to connect with their corporate credentials or create local accounts. JAMS allows you to manage your own Jami community while taking advantage of Jami’s distributed network architecture.

Jami is available for GNU/Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Android TV, and web browsers, making Jami an interoperable and cross-platform communication framework.

Manage multiple SIP accounts, Jami accounts, and JAMS accounts with the Jami client installed on one or multiple devices.

Jami is free, unlimited, private, advertising‑free, compatible, fast, autonomous, and anonymous.

Build IoT projects with Jami. Re-use the universal communications technology of Jami with its portable library on your system of choice.

Jami for Android TV is tested on NVIDIA SHIELD TV with Logitech cameras.
